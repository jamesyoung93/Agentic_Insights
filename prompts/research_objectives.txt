## Primary Objective
Identify key drivers of customer loyalty and revenue in the coffee shop chain business. 
Investigate how customer attributes, behaviors, and competitor interactions influence 
visit frequency, spending, and satisfaction.

## Specific Questions to Explore
1. What customer segments have the highest lifetime value?
2. How do seasonal patterns affect revenue across different regions?
3. What is the relationship between mobile app usage and customer retention?
4. How does competitor activity impact our customer behavior?
5. Are there geographic differences in price sensitivity?
6. What factors most strongly predict customer churn?
7. How do promotions affect customer visit patterns?
8. What is the optimal wait time threshold for maintaining satisfaction?

METHODOLOGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report was generated through autonomous discovery involving:

1. ITERATIVE RESEARCH CYCLES
   - Each cycle: question generation → data analysis → synthesis
   - World model tracks cumulative knowledge

2. DATA ANALYSIS
   - Python code generated for each research question
   - Statistical tests: correlations, t-tests, regressions
   - Significance threshold: p < 0.05

3. IMPORTANT CAVEAT
   ⚠️  All findings are OBSERVATIONAL and CORRELATIONAL
   ⚠️  Correlation does NOT imply causation
   ⚠️  Experimental validation required for causal claims

  - Temporal factors (seasonality, trends)
  - Selection bias in sample
  - Measurement error

  - Spurious correlation

Recommendations for Stronger Inference:
  • Collect longitudinal/time-series data
  • Control for confounders via regression
  • Replicate in independent dataset

====================================================================================================
LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS
====================================================================================================

1. DATA LIMITATIONS
   • Cross-sectional data (cannot establish temporal causation)
   • Potential selection bias
   • Measurement error in self-reported data

2. STATISTICAL LIMITATIONS
   • Multiple comparisons not corrected (risk of false positives)
   • Confounders not fully controlled
   • Effect sizes not consistently reported

3. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
   • Automated analysis may have errors
   • No experimental manipulation (all observational)
   • Single dataset (requires replication)

4. CAUSAL INFERENCE
   • All findings are CORRELATIONAL unless proven otherwise
   • To establish causation, need:
     - Temporal precedence (X before Y)
     - No confounders
     - Experimental validation

RECOMMENDATION: Treat all discoveries as hypothesis-generating.
Validate with experiments (A/B tests) before making business decisions.

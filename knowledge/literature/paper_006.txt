ABSTRACT
--------
Study of 125,000 customer interactions reveals non-linear relationship between wait time and satisfaction. Satisfaction drops sharply after 5-minute threshold (slope change: -0.3 to -0.8 points/minute). Mobile order-ahead reduces wait by average 3.2 minutes and improves satisfaction by 18%.

KEY FINDINGS
-----------
1. Critical wait time threshold: 5 minutes
2. Satisfaction decline accelerates after threshold (-0.8 pts/min)
3. Mobile order-ahead reduces wait by 3.2 minutes (40%)
4. Peak hours (7-9 AM) show highest wait-satisfaction correlation

METHODS
-------
Non-linear regression, queuing theory, time-motion studies

KEYWORDS
--------
wait time, customer satisfaction, operations, service quality

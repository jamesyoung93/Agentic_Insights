  "abstract": "Study of 125,000 customer interactions reveals non-linear relationship between wait time and satisfaction. Satisfaction drops sharply after 5-minute threshold (slope change: -0.3 to -0.8 points/minute). Mobile order-ahead reduces wait by average 3.2 minutes and improves satisfaction by 18%.",
